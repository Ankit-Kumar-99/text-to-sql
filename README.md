# 📊 NL2SQL Marketing Analytics Engine

A modular Natural Language → SQL engine for marketing analytics built using Google Gemini.

This system converts user questions into validated, schema-aware SQL queries while preventing common NL2SQL failures like:

* ❌ Schema hallucination
* ❌ Fact-to-fact join explosion
* ❌ Invalid columns
* ❌ Grain misuse
* ❌ Raw fact joins

---

# 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements a **two-stage NL2SQL architecture**:

1. **Intent Extraction (Structured JSON)**
2. **SQL Generation (Schema-aware + Grain-safe)**

With:

* Schema-aware prompting
* Strict validation layer
* Modular architecture
* Retry mechanism
* Clean separation of concerns

# 📌 Detailed Execution Flow

## Step 1: User Input

```bash
Enter your analytics question:
> What is total spend by campaign?
```

Handled in:

```python
main.py
```

---

## Step 2: Intent Extraction

File: `app/nl2sql.py`

Prompt source: `app/prompts.py`

LLM returns structured JSON:

```json
{
  "tables_required": ["campaign_performance"],
  "columns_required": ["campaign_name", "spend"],
  "aggregations": ["SUM(spend)"],
  "filters": [],
  "group_by": ["campaign_name"],
  "order_by": "",
  "limit": null,
  "joins_required": false
}
```

### Why This Stage Exists

Without structured intent:

* SQL becomes unstable
* Model hallucinates joins
* Hard to validate

This enforces logical planning before query writing.

---

## Step 3: SQL Generation

The SQL prompt receives:

* Database schema
* Grain definitions
* Intent JSON

Critical rules enforced:

* campaign_performance = campaign-level
* email_events = event-level
* web_analytics = event-level
* No raw fact-to-fact joins
* Must aggregate before joining fact tables

Example output:

```sql
SELECT campaign_name, SUM(spend)
FROM campaign_performance
GROUP BY campaign_name;
```

---

## Step 4: SQL Cleaning

Removes:

* Markdown fences
* ```sql blocks
  ```
* Extra whitespace

Ensures raw SQL only.

---

## Step 5: SQL Validation

File: `app/validator.py`

Checks:

* Table existence
* Column validity
* Alias correctness

Example failure caught:

```
❌ Invalid column 'revenue' in table 'campaign_performance'
```

# 🧩 Core Design Principles

## 1️⃣ Separation of Concerns

| Layer            | Responsibility     |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| prompts.py       | Prompt engineering |
| schema.py        | Database knowledge |
| validator.py     | Safety layer       |
| nl2sql.py        | Orchestration      |
| gemini_client.py | LLM communication  |

---

## 2️⃣ Grain Awareness

Tables have different grain:

| Table                | Grain                 |
| -------------------- | --------------------- |
| campaign_performance | 1 row per campaign    |
| email_events         | 1 row per email event |
| web_analytics        | 1 row per web event   |

This prevents:

* Multiplication errors
* Incorrect aggregations
* Fact-to-fact explosion

---

## 3️⃣ Safe Fact Table Joins

If both:

* email_events
* web_analytics

are used, the system enforces:

```
1) Aggregate separately by campaign_id
2) Then JOIN aggregated results
```

Never:

```
email_events JOIN web_analytics (raw)
```

---

# 📊 Database Schema

### campaign_performance

Campaign-level metrics:

* impressions
* clicks
* spend
* conversions

### email_events

Event-level email data:

* event_type
* timestamp

### web_analytics

Web tracking events:

* session_id
* event_name
* purchase_value
* device
* country

# 📈 Current Accuracy

| Query Type           | Accuracy |
| -------------------- | -------- |
| Simple Aggregation   | ~95%     |
| Multi-table joins    | ~85–90%  |
| Time-based queries   | ~75–85%  |
| Diagnostic questions | Limited  |

---

# ⚠️ Known Limitations

* No automatic comparison logic (week-over-week)
* No diagnostic reasoning engine
* No query execution layer
* No cost-based optimization
* No ambiguity detection ("best", "top")

---

# 🛣 Future Roadmap

* Automatic time comparison templates
* Purchase-event auto filtering
* Funnel conversion logic

## Phase 2 – Engineering Improvements

* Add FastAPI backend
* Add caching
* Add logging system
* Add query benchmarking framework
* Add test harness

## Phase 3 – Enterprise Features

* Role-based access
* Multi-database support
* Semantic metric layer
* Attribution modeling
* Auto BI insights

* Revenue per click
* Sessions last week
* Email events vs conversions
* Campaign performance filters
* Device-level revenue
* ROAS by campaign

# 🧠 Why Two-Stage NL2SQL?

Most failures in NL2SQL happen because:

* Model jumps directly to SQL
* No structured planning
* No schema enforcement
* No validation layer

This architecture solves that by:

```
Natural Language
        ↓
Structured Intent
        ↓
Controlled SQL Generation
        ↓
Strict Validation
```

---

# 🏁 Summary

This system is:

* Modular
* Scalable
* Grain-aware
* Schema-safe
* Production-ready foundation

It moves beyond a toy NL2SQL script into a structured analytics engine.
